Website for Small Business

This project involved developing a professional website for a small business to showcase its services and provide an easy way for potential clients to reach out. The website featured a structured layout detailing the company's offerings and included a custom-built contact form integrated with an email server to ensure reliable message delivery.

The project was discontinued before full deployment, but the completed work stands as a strong example of my expertise in Laravel development, email server integration, and best practices for maintainable and scalable web applications.

A key challenge was configuring the contact form to reliably send emails via an external SMTP server while maintaining security. This required fine-tuning SMTP settings, handling authentication, and implementing error logging to ensure successful message delivery.
